## Cloud Native Buildpacks

### What is CNBs?
- The CNB project was initiated by Pivotal and Heroku in January 2018 and joined the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) as an Apache-2.0 licensed project in October 2018.
- Cloud Native Buildpacks (CNBs) **transform your application source code into container images** that can run on any cloud.
- With buildpacks, organizations can concentrate the knowledge of container build best practices within a specialized team, **instead of having application developers across the organization individually maintain their own Dockerfiles**.
- This makes it easier to know what is inside application images, enforce security and compliance requirements, and perform upgrades with minimal effort and intervention.

#
### Why CNBs?
- Control - Balanced control between App Devs and Operators.
- Compliance - Ensure apps meet security and compliance requirements.
- Maintainability - Perform upgrades with minimal effort and intervention.

#### Features of CNBs:
- It auto-detects your code's programming language and its version
- Advanced Caching
- <mark>Images can be built directly from application source without additional instructions</mark>.
- Supports more than one programming language family.
- Image contains only what is necessary.
- Leverage production-ready buildpacks maintained by the community.

### Deploy NodeJS application using Cloud Native Builpacks

#### Pre-requisites:

- AWS account
- An Ubuntu EC2 machine t2.micro (t2.micro is ok, if you are using simple application)
- Docker installed

#
#### Steps:
- Update your machine
```bash
sudo apt update
```
#
- Install docker
```bash
sudo apt install docker.io -y
```
#
- Provide permission to ubuntu user to docker group
```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER && newgrp docker
```
#
- Install pack utility to build image
```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:cncf-buildpacks/pack-cli
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install pack-cli
```
#
- Clone your code
```bash
git clone https://github.com/udaybambal/buildpacks-django-notes-app.git
```
#
- Go inside the directory
```bash
cd node-todo-cicd
```
#
- Run the following command to get the pack builder
```bash
pack build suggest
```
#
- Copy the google builder and paste in the below command
```bash
pack build --builder=<your-builder-from-above-command> node-app
```

> [!Note]
> This build will take some time be patient.

#
- After build, check images
```bash
docker images
```
#
- Run the image as a container
```bash
docker run -itd --name nodeapp -p 8000:8000 node-app
```
> [!Note]
> This application runs on port 8000, that's why we mentioned 8000 in the above command
#
- Open port 8000 from the security groups and access your application
```bash
http://<public-ip>:8000
```
#
Congratulations!!! you have deployed and application using Cloud Native Buildpacks.
